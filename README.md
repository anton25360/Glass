# Glass web (deprecated)
Glass has been completely rebuilt from the ground up as a native mobile app using the React Native framework.  
The old app is still accessible [here](https://anton25360.github.io/Glass/app/), and you can find out more about the **new** Glass at its repo [here](https://github.com/anton25360/GlassNative).
